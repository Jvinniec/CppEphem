DISCLAIMER:
----------------------------------------------------------
The author above had no connection or involvement in the
development of the SOFA software. Their software is included
in this package because it is the standard provided by the
International Astronomical Union (IAU). I dont claim to own
their code. You can view the readme file in the sofa directory
for more information on this software. (Can I not be sued now?)

PURPOSE:
----------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this package is to leverage the Standards
Of Fundamental Astronomy (SOFA) package in order to allow
simple coordinate conversion routines. This should allow
converting between [RA,Dec], [Galactice Long, Lat], and
local sky coordinates.

Here is a list of purposes I wish this code to serve:
* Basic coordinate conversion routines
  - J2000 (RA,Dec)
  - Galactic (Long, Lat)
  - Local Sky (Az, Alt)
* Planet ephemeris
  - Planet positions
