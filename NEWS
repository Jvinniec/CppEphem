v1.3.0
------
The CECoordinates class has been DEPRECATED and replaced by the CESkyCoord 
class. The CESkyCoord class has a simpler interface with fewer methods for 
converting between coordinate systems. It also supports ecliptic coordinates.
All classes and executables have been rewritten to use CESkyCoord. A constructor
has been provided to make the transition a little simpler.

As the number of supported coordinate systems is growing, the existing 
executables for converting between these systems have been replaced by a single
executable 'convcoord' which is capable of converting between any of the 
supported coordinate systems. This method also supports passing angles in the 
form of HH:MM:SS and DD:MM:SS using a user specified delimiter (see the 'delim'
parameter).


v1.2.0
-------
This represents the most significant change to the code base since its creation.
The most significant change involves more accurate coordinates by including
the automatic download of 'UT1-UTC', 'x,y-polar motion', and "TT-UT1" correction
values. These values are also automatically applied to coordinate conversions
and planet position computations.

Another decision that has been made is the choice to deprecate the autotools
based method for installing the code. This is being done due to the complexity
of maintaining the build system and testing code. It's just too much effort for
a small project with a one-man development team. In the next release (v1.3.0)
the autotools system will be removed and CMake will be required.
