v1.2.0
-------
This represents the most significant change to the code base since its creation.
The most significant change involves more accurate coordinates by including
the automatic download of 'UT1-UTC', 'x,y-polar motion', and "TT-UT1" correction
values. These values are also automatically applied to coordinate conversions
and planet position computations.

Another decision that has been made is the choice to deprecate the autotools
based method for installing the code. This is being done due to the complexity
of maintaining the build system and testing code. It's just too much effort for
a small project with a one-man development team. In the next release (v1.3.0)
the autotools system will be removed and CMake will be required.
