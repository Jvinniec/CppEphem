This file is used exclusively for testing the
code.

For some of the sofa methods, it is required
to supply the 'UT1-UTC' value for an accurate
result. This value is also known as 'dut1'.
These methods generally also take x,y polar
motion correction values.

This file contains the daily 'dut1', 'xpolar',
and 'ypolar' values for every date in the 
following range:
      start:  December 22, 1999 (MJD 51534)
      stop :  January  11, 2000 (MJD 51554)

A definition of the column values can be found
here:
      http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/readme.finals

A full list of all the correction values (going 
back to January 2, 1973) can be found here:
      http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/finals2000A.all

If the code is compiled with libcurl support, 
this full list of correction values will be
downloaded automatically the first time these
corrections are requested. The full file size
is a few megabytes.

*****************************************

This file is used exclusively for testing the

For some of the sofa methods, it is required
to supply the 'TT-UT1' value for an accurate
result. 

This file contains monthly 'TT-UT1' values in
the following range:
      start:  December, 1999
      stop :  February, 2000

A definition of the column values:
       1973  2  1  43.4724

A full list of all the correction values (going 
back to February, 1973) can be found here:
      http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/deltat.data

If the code is compiled with libcurl support, 
this full list of correction values will be
downloaded automatically the first time these
corrections are requested. The full file size
is 10-15 kilobytes.

*****************************************

This file is used exclusively for testing the
code.

For some of the sofa methods, it is required
to supply the 'TT-UT1' value for an accurate
result. 

This file contains quarterly 'TT-UT1' values in 
the following range:
      start:  January, 2019
      stop :  October, 2027

A definition of the column values is provided
in the header of the file. Relevant column 
indices are (0-based):
      MJD    [3-11]
      TT-UT1 [23-28]

A full list of all the correction values can 
be found here:
      http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/deltat.pred

If the code is compiled with libcurl support, 
this full list of correction values will be
downloaded automatically the first time these
corrections are requested. The full file size
is insignificant
