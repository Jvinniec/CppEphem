This file is used exclusively for testing the
code.

For some of the sofa methods, it is required
to supply the 'UT1-UTC' value for an accurate
result. This value is also known as 'dut1'.
These methods generally also take x,y polar
motion correction values.

This file contains the daily 'dut1', 'xpolar',
and 'ypolar' values for every date in the 
following range:
      start:  December 22, 1999 (MJD 51534)
      stop :  January  11, 2000 (MJD 51554)

A definition of the column values can be found
here:

A full list of all the correction values (going 
back to January 2, 1973) can be found here:
      http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/finals2000A.all

If the code is compiled with libcurl support, 
this full list of correction values will be
downloaded automatically the first time these
corrections are requested. The full file size
is a few megabytes.
